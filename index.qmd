**Summary**

I’m a Data Science student with a strong background in statistics, machine learning, and neural networks, particularly in areas like natural language processing (NLP). I have practical experience working with Python, R, and SQL, tackling real-world challenges in fields like public health, environmental issues, and AI ethics. As an officer in my school’s Data Science Club and a PALiISaDS scholar, I lead projects, develop analytical models, and communicate insights effectively. I’m passionate about using data to drive positive change and solve complex problems.
