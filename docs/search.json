I have practical experience working with Python, R, and SQL, tackling real-world challenges in fields like public health, environmental issues, and AI ethics. As an officer in my school’s Data Science Club and a PALiISaDS scholar, I lead projects, develop analytical models, and communicate insights effectively. I’m passionate about using data to drive positive change and solve complex problems."
