## Projects

**Text Classification Using LSTM Neural Networks** (Python, TensorFlow/Keras, Keras Tuner, Scikit-learn, Pandas)

- Enhanced two NLP models using Bidirectional LSTM for spam detection and sentiment analysis across over 15,000 emails and product review texts.  
- Designed and optimized final architectures with Keras Tuner, dropout regularization, and class balancing over a two-week development cycle.  
- Achieved 98.7% test accuracy for binary spam detection and 85.7% on multi-class sentiment classification using tuned BiLSTM architecture.
